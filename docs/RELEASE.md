# Release contract and recovery

`.github/workflows/release.yml` runs on `pull_request_target` **closed/merged**
events for main. The merged-only guard and exact base-repository merge SHA are
mandatory: an unmerged fork head is never checked out with publishing permissions.
Checkout v7's explicit opt-in applies only inside these merged-only jobs; ordinary
PR `Test` uses read-only permissions and no publishing secrets. Action SHAs are
pinned. Self-hosted runners must support their Node 24 runtime.

Release runs are serialized with `queue: max`, retaining up to 100 pending runs
instead of replacing a previous pending merge. GitHub's queue limit still applies;
cancelled runs can be retried for the same eligible merge. The pinned actionlint
does not yet understand `queue`; the workflow checker validates its values,
cancellation policy and duplicate keys separately, suppressing only that known
unsupported-key diagnostic. All other actionlint checks remain enabled.

リリースは`queue: max`で直列実行し、GitHubの上限である100件まで待機できます。
待機中のマージを次のマージで置き換えません。取り消された実行は同じ適格マージで再実行します。
固定版actionlintが未対応の`queue`は別途検証し、他のlint検証は維持します。

The workflow resolves the commit/version and both runners once, reserves an
unpublished draft, builds native ISO/QCOW2/VMDK/source candidates, stages complete
per-architecture sets, validates the aggregate, uploads its Actions artifact, and
only then promotes the draft. A missing/failed/skipped required stage blocks the
publication transition. `producer.actions.promote` requires the uploaded
artifact ID/digest and checks its exact workflow source commit.

No public binary release has been published. The latest retained native cohorts
have corresponding-source restoration, component clearance and guest-lifecycle
receipts; exact candidate results and remaining failures are recorded in
[PR #2](https://github.com/michibiki-io/shirube-os/pull/2). Historical component
reports are scoped to their recorded inputs, not a reason to repeat completed
checks. Neither those receipts nor `license-audit.json` alone replace the final
aggregate validator. Failed or missing required evidence still blocks publication.

For unpublished validation, retained binaries and sources keep their original
source commit and signing cohort. A later verifier-only change is recorded as a
separate runtime-verifier/review head; it never relabels the retained source set
as a new build. Production publication still requires the exact eligible merged
commit and the complete coherent candidate contract below.

`Test` is static validation. Its success does not establish image acceptance.

`producer.policy.eligible` accepts relevant PRs merged into main and their exact
40-character merge commit. Unmerged PRs, docs-only changes and direct pushes are
excluded from expensive builds and publication. Relevant paths are producer,
containers, source lock, patches, guest integration, tests, workflow/schema and
logo changes. The project policy intentionally uses native AMD64/ARM64 runner variables and
requires a new Shirube revision for every relevant eligible merged commit. Those issue-specific
rules override generic container-registry/QEMU release defaults.

Release versions follow `v<Stream YYYY.MM>.<Shirube revision>`. With pinned
Stream `2026.03`, the first release is `v2026.03.0`; each new eligible merged
commit on that baseline advances the revision (`v2026.03.1`, `v2026.03.2`, ...).
Updating the pinned baseline to `2026.04` starts `v2026.04.0`. A baseline downgrade
is rejected. The month keeps its leading zero; this is a Stream-aligned version
scheme, not strict SemVer. Tags, release titles, ISO/disk/source names, Shirube integration-package
versions, manifests and OS version output use the same resolved value. Third-party
component versions remain at their exact pinned upstream values.

Unpublished drafts reserve their version even if their build or validation fails.
A later eligible commit skips versions reserved by other commits and receives the
next revision; rerunning the same commit keeps its own reserved version. Only
published releases establish the release ancestry check. Draft reservations
affect version allocation, not ancestry or permission to publish.

Conventional Commit subjects/bodies and SHAs form release notes, including
breaking-change notices. Their type does not change Stream's year/month. PR
titles do not determine versions or substitute for individual commits. GitHub
commit metadata is checked for complete coverage. The exact eligible merged
commit/version is resolved once and shared by both architectures; reruns keep
the reserved version and follow the immutable asset checks above.

`producer.release.validate` validates the metadata contract against actual files:
identity, complete architecture/role sets, physical sizes, hashes, checksum
coverage, candidate generations, required check outcomes, detailed evidence and
exact source/license members. Every required result must be `PASS`; `SKIP`,
`NOT_RUN`, missing checks and inconsistent evidence fail. This validator does not
execute a VM: it consumes evidence from a trusted producer. Synthetic validator
fixtures are explicitly marked and are not runtime acceptance evidence.

Candidate generations bind each architecture's ISO/disks/source/evidence to the
same build-internal signing keys. Before publication, reuse only a complete
verified candidate; otherwise rebuild the whole architecture candidate and
regenerate aggregate metadata in unpublished staging. Never mix generations.

Publish only after every required gate passes and the entire asset set exists in
an unpublished draft. Every source component archive must be below the GitHub
2 GiB per-asset limit. Hash every asset plus `manifest.json` in `SHA256SUMS`;
checksums do not include themselves. Verify all source archives and their member
hashes. Retain source archives with the binaries in the same release.

GitHub permits at most 1000 assets per release, including the manifest and
checksum list ([release quotas](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/releasing-projects-on-github/about-releases)).
Debian source components are grouped into plain-tar parts of at most 16
components, with a conservative 1 GiB input budget per part. Their original
source archives, copyright files and recipes remain byte-identical under separate
component directories. The inventory gives each exact part/member/hash reference;
the normal source restoration command handles these parts directly. Custom
component archives retain their existing format. Each new part is independently
re-read before original intermediate component archives are removed. Aggregate
validation counts the manifest/checksum assets, and draft staging rejects an
over-limit set before deleting or uploading any candidate material.

After publication, reruns must download and verify the complete recorded set,
including metadata, before doing any build work. An exact match is a verification-
only no-op. Missing or changed published material fails without any upload,
replacement, metadata rewrite or repair. Recover with a new eligible merged
change and superseding version. Reconcile uncertain publication outcomes against
live release state before retrying. Draft staging and final promotion are implemented in `producer.actions`.
They recheck draft ownership before writes and reconcile uncertain final
publication against live release state without rewriting a published set.

OCI status is independently `NOT_RUN`. The current validator refuses a positive
OCI claim because live-evidence validation is not implemented. Local QEMU boot
success cannot establish live OCI compatibility.

The skill-based release baseline was rendered and inspected before adaptation.
This OS producer intentionally does not publish builder containers to a registry,
use QEMU for cross-architecture compilation, or require Helm/cloud deployment.
Relevant merged PRs are selected by actual changed paths rather than PR-title
formatting. `scripts/release/compute_release.py` and
`scripts/release/generate_release_notes.py` expose the same canonical policy for
local inspection.

Release manifests and per-architecture evidence bind the explicitly selected
`qemu_accelerator` (`kvm` or validated `tcg`). A missing or differing value fails
validation. Architecture-specific virtualization/runtime/resource variables are
documented in [BUILD.md](BUILD.md); resource or virtualization failure does not
choose another runner or publish a partial result. Policy accepts explicit TCG
for both architectures, and the release workflow defaults to TCG for both hosted
runner classes. This is not runtime acceptance: historical ARM64 TCG component
passes and the retained ARM64 native-KVM candidate are distinct evidence.
Complete hosted-candidate resource/time and runtime acceptance remain separately
gated; see [BUILD.md](BUILD.md#explicit-release-virtualization-and-container-runtime)
and [retained candidate evidence](VALIDATION.md#retained-candidate-evidence-2026-11-11).
